Implement Producer / Cosumer using Mutex an Condition Variable

DO NOT modify the following files : main.c, buffer.c, buffer.h, prod_con.h
Modify ONLY, prod_con.c

compile: gcc buffer.c prod_con.c main.c
run: ./a.out

Read all the files carefully
Implement all the functions in prod_con.c

Use the following function to check if buffer is full/empty : buffer_full(), buffer_empty()

Job is produced to / consumed from the buffer using the functions: produce_to_buffer(), consume_from_buffer()
These functions the already called from withing produce() / consume()
Add your code before / after these calls to manage mutex / condition variable
